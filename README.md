# Transition-metal-atoms-encapsulated-on-Silicalite-1
This repository contains the optimised structures (VASP CONTCAR files) for the full set of 3d, 4d, and 5d transition metal atoms encapsulated on MFI-type Silicalite-1 zeolite, used in my research work entitled "Transition Metal Atoms Encapsulated within Microporous Silicalite-1 Zeolite: A Systematic Computational Study"
